adventofcode.com is a twenty-five day December advent calendar with fifty programming challenges. The site has released all their challenges for the year, but I've only finished up to Day 7 so far.

I haven't kept up with the challenges as they were released each day, but I'm still very proud of my progress! I've been enrolling in C++ classes at a local community college and it's been fun applying what I've learned so far. comparing my recent code to my Day 1 code , I've seen an improvement and I am excited to keep progressing! :)
